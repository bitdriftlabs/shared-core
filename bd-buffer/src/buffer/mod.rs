// RingBufferProducer
//

// A producer (writer) for a ring buffer. Producers produce individual records to be consumed by
// consumers. Individual records are created via reserve()/commit() API call pairs.

// an extra allocation for every reservation. Same for startRead()/finishRead() below.

  // previous reservation.
  // @param size supplies the size of space to reserve.
  // @param block supplies whether to block or not during reserve. Blocking can happen if no
  //        overwrites are allowed and readers have not read.
  // @return either a span that specifies the reserved space to write into, or an error indicating
  // why the space could not be reserved. Note that the returned space is guaranteed to be
  // contiguous.

//
// RingBufferConsumer
//

// A consumer (reader) for a ring buffer. Consumers read individual records produced by producers.
// Every startRead()/finishRead() call pair will return a record that was originally produced via a
// reserve()/commit() call pair.
#[async_trait::async_trait]

  // will not return until there is data available or an unrelated error. If block is false, the
  // call will return the unavailable status.

// RingBufferCursorConsumer
//

// A consumer (reader) for a ring buffer that offers a cursor interface as opposed to a concurrent
// reader interface. As such, by definition, any buffer that offers a cursor consumer will only
// provide a single consumer. It will also *not* allow data overwrites. Although this interface
// looks similar to RingBufferConsumer, it is semantically different and kept separate for type
// checking reasons.

  // to be read in the buffer.

  // Advance the read pointer forward and thus allow the advanced record to be overwritten. In
  // practice, this API is paired with startRead() and can only be called after a successful call to
  // startRead(), but does not have to interleave back and forth with that API. I.e., it is possible
  // to call startRead(), startRead(), advanceReadPointer(), startRead(), etc. Calling this releases
  // the oldest read data acquired with startRead().

// LockHandle
//

// A lock handle acquired via the lock() function. Destroying the handle will unlock the buffer.

  // reservations. This function can be used to wait until all existing reservations are drained.

//
// RingBuffer
//

// A ring buffer interface that offers:
// 1) Registering 1 or more producers.
// 2) Registering 1 or more consumers.
// 3) No blocking writing (space will either be reserved or a reason given for space not being
// reserved). 4) Opaque records using variable record sizes. 5) Contiguous reservations. This means
// that buffers are guaranteed to not be split across the wrap point. This simplifies overall
// operation at the cost of not using all bytes in the buffer. The assumption is that in general the
// size of the buffer is much larger than the average reservation size.
//
// Different implementations of this interface have different performance and volatility
// characteristics and also may support a different number of producers and consumers (e.g.,
// multiple producer and single consumer, single producer and single consumer, etc.). See the
// documentation for specific implementations for more details.

  // This function waits for data to be drained *at the point in which this function is invoked.*
  // Draining is defined as all pending data has been read from the buffer. This means that any new
  // writes that come in after this call will not count towards the wait time. A few notes: 1)
  // drain_complete_cb supplies the callback to invoke when the drain is complete. 2) The callback
  // may be invoked immediately in the context of this call if there is no data to drain. 3) The
  // callback may be invoked on a different thread from the thread that invoked this call. The
  // callback should be thread safe. 4) Only a single callback is stored at a given time and there
  // is no way currently to cancel a callback. If this function is called again before the previous
  // drain is completed, the previous callback will never be called and the new drain will start.
  fn wait_for_drain(&self);

  // This function flushes all data *at the point in which this function is invoked.* What flushing
  // means is dependent on the underlying buffer implementation. For example, the aggregate buffer
  // will make sure data has been persisted to the non-volatile buffer. All of the same notes
  // provided for waitForDrain() also apply to this function.
  fn flush(&self);

  // Shutdown the ring buffer. This will release any blocked readers and prevent any new writes from
  // being accepted. This function implicitly performs a lock() and flush() on the buffer and will
  // block until these operations are complete. It also cannot be undone and is meant to be called
  // prior to an orderly shutdown.
  fn shutdown(&self);

  // Locks the ring buffer. This means that the buffer will no longer accept new writes. All
  // attempted reservations will be failed with a FAILED_PRECONDITION error code. Once locked, the
  // lock handle can be used to access a read-only view of the buffer. When the lock handle is
  // destroyed the buffer will become unlocked. Locks can be stacked. Only when the last lock handle
  // is destroyed will the buffer be unlocked.
